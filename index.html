      <h2 style="font-family: montserrat;">Biography</h2>
      <p style="font-family: montserrat;">
      My name is Akinniyi Deborah Inioluwa,a student in the schoool of
      engineering at Altschool. 
     I was born on
      October 15,2006, into a family of seven. My name in Hebrew means "bee"
      while its spiritual meaning implies "judgement". I come from a Nigerian
      family,and I know how to speak Yoruba,English,as well as pidgin. I have
      three older siblings and one younger sister. I currently live with my
      parents in a simple yet comfortable bungalow. I would describe myself as
      being very introverted and quiet. I'm also very independent. I really
      don't like working with partners,unless they are my friends or I feel
      comfortable around them. But I generally like to do things on my own.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: montserrat;">
      I'm a student,precisely a university aspirant. I'm also a baker. I'm
      involved in baking cakes for events
      (birthday,engagement,wedding...),making snacks(small
      chops,doughnut,shawarma,croissant roll...),as well as serving dishes at
      parties. Though still learning,I can boldly attest to my competence.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: montserrat;">

      I also like to relax and I have a weak spot for babies and animals. I
      dislike a lot of things, to be quite honest. I generally dislike being
      falsely accused,backbiting,and sharing personal items[clothes,footwears].
      I think some of my strength would be my independence,calmness,kindness and
      ability to think and sail through difficult situations. I like being
      independent,and I hate depending on others for things. I'm pretty calm and
      in most difficult situations,I try to not let things stress me out too
      much and I tend to be very laid back. I'm a very polite,nice person to
      everyone, even if they are rude to me. I'm also the type of person that
      doesn't allow any situation to hold me back, I make sure to create
      solution to whatever problem that comes my way. My motto is
      <em>"Never Give up".</em>This motto has always kept me going,right from
      being a child. I never allow anything to weigh me down or cause me
      depression. This motto taught me to be resillient and strive harder.

      <ul style="
      font-family: montserrat;">
      
      
      <li>I joined altschool in order to become a backend engineer,not just a
      backend engineer,rather a qualified and competent backend engineer.</li>
<li>      Altschool africa is a widely-known,reputable school with different
      sections,ranging from school of engineering, to school of data, school of
      product, school of creative economy and school of business.

      </ul>
      
      <header style="font-family: montserrat;"><h2>Goals</h2></header>
      <p style="font-family: montserrat;">My goals
      for school of engineering programme include learning a new skill,attaining a
      a new position,creating a positive work-life balance,expanding my network
      and improving my efficiency. <br />As technology experiences constant
      rapid changes,the need to learn a new skills and adjust to new processes
      arises. New technologies or discoveries may require learning of skills.
      Refining my soft skills such as communication,problem-solving and time
      management is also beneficial in growing my abilities and improving my
      work,as it strengthens my work and my opportunity to advance in my career.
      <br />As an engineer, my goal is to advance in my career and achieve a
      higher position that requires greater responsibilities, as each new
      position I attain, improves my resume and prepare me for further
      advancement in my field. <br />Engineering roles often include long hours
      and a high volume of work. Therefore, I aim to create and maintain a
      positive work-life balance. This means setting reasonable limits between
      my personal time and my working hours. Having a healthy balance between
      work and my personal life can improve my job satisfaction, prevent burnout
      and help me in achieving my larger goals. <br />Another goal of mine is
      expanding my network. As an engineer, networking with other engineers
      keeps me informed about upcoming projects or openings that align with my
      overall career goal. Developing a professional network can help me learn
      about promotions, new roles, new skills and new opportunities in my field.
      <br />Engineers typically design or build products, systems and solutions.
      They often use a trial-and-error process and seek the most efficient ways
      of operating. As an engineer who is looking to advance my career and
      improve my output, I make it a goal to improve my efficiency. Improving
      work efficiency can allow me to focus more energy on meeting other goals
      advance and boost my chances of receiving promotions.
